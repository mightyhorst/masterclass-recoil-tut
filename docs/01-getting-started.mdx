## Create React App

Recoil is a state management library for React, so you need to have React installed and running to use Recoil. The easiest and recommended way for bootstrapping a React application is to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app):

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
```

> [`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f).

For more ways to install Create React App, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app).

> Check the installation with `yarn start`
