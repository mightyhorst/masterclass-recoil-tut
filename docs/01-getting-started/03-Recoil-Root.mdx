## RecoilRoot

Components that use recoil state need `RecoilRoot` to appear somewhere in the parent tree. A good place to put this is in your root component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  RecoilRoot,
  atom,
  selector,
  useRecoilState,
  useRecoilValue,
} from 'recoil';

function App() {
  return (
    <RecoilRoot>
      <CharacterCounter />
    </RecoilRoot>
  );
}
```

We'll implement the `CharacterCounter` component in the following section.
